## **Data Analytic Tools for Business Decision Making**

*Prerequisites for this course*
- Experience working with data (Excel)
- A drive to learn.
- No programming required, but may be helpful. 

### Key Terms and Data Types
**Database**
- Databases store and organize data. 
- Contain multiple _tables_ which makes data easily accessible.
- Each Table is a spreadsheet-like in nature. They contain **rows** and **columns**. 

**Query**
- A single request or action on the database.
- They can be SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT or DELETE

_Example_

```sql
SELECT * FROM TABLE;
```

**DBMS: database management system**
- A program which interacts with the database, user and other applications to capture and analyze data. 
- MySQL, SQL Server Management Studio and PostgreSQL are examples. 

**SQL: Structured Query Language**
- A programming language made to capture and analyze data in a database. 
- SQL is considered a __declaritive language__ meaning the user simply needs to state what they want returned and not have to worry about how it is done. 

**SQL Order of Operations** 

- The order that SQL runs.
- SQL runs differently than the order you type in. 
- For this reason, the order of operations must be obeyed for the Query to perform as expected.
