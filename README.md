> About 80 percent of adults experience low back pain at some point in their lifetimes. It is the most common cause of job-related disability and a leading contributor to missed work days. [-National Institute of Health](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Low-Back-Pain-Fact-Sheet)

Utilizing technology to enhance the lives of people always has, and always be my life's mission. If we could produce a model which accurately predicts low back pain, then perhaps anatomical measurements could be examined more routinely as an indicator of back health.
